A 8051 MCU passcode lock project, read the .c file for more
Tim Feirg, kkcocogogo@gmail.com

this is just a final project for my MCU course, I've included the MCU board design(including .pdf file and proteus design),
as well as the 1602 LCD data sheet.

I never learnt how to use github, and I don't know how to write markdown.
if the code's terrible, please let me know.
